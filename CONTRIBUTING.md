# Contributing to the Restaurant POS System ü§ù

Hey there! üëã Thanks for checking out the Restaurant POS System. I'm excited to open this project up for contributions and see what we can build together! Since I've been the only developer so far, I wanted to lay out a few simple guidelines to make contributing as smooth as possible.

## Code of Conduct 

I want to keep this a friendly and welcoming space for everyone. So, please be respectful and considerate in your interactions. Let's keep things positive and collaborative!

## How to Contribute 

Here's the lowdown on how you can help make this project even better:

1.  **Fork the Repo:**

    Hit that "Fork" button at the top right of the GitHub page. This makes a copy of the project in your own account.

2.  **Clone It:**

    Grab your forked copy and bring it to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YasinShamsedini/RestaurantPOS.git
    cd RestaurantPOS
    ```

    (Replace those bracketed bits with your actual info!)

3.  **Make a Branch:**

    Create a new branch for whatever you're working on:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/awesome-new-thing
    # or
    git checkout -b fix/that-pesky-bug
    ```

4.  **Get Coding!**

    Time to work your magic! A few things to keep in mind:

    *   **Python:**
        *   Try to stick to the PEP 8 style (it's just a good habit!).
        *   Use names that make sense for your variables and functions.
        *   Comments are your friends (especially when things get tricky).
    *   **SQL:**
        *   Keep table and column names consistent.
        *   Write queries that are efficient (the database will thank you!).
        *   Explain what your queries are doing with comments.
    *   **General:**
        *   Small, focused commits are easier to review (and less scary!).
        *   Write a good commit message (more on that below).

5.  **Test It Out:**

    Make sure your changes actually work! If you're adding a new feature, try to write a test for it.

6.  **Commit It:**

    Tell everyone what you did with a clear commit message:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Added cool new feature"
    # or
    git commit -m "fix: Fixed a bug that was causing problems"
    ```

    I like to use these prefixes in my commit messages:

    *   `feat:` For new features
    *   `fix:` For bug fixes
    *   `docs:` For changes to the documentation
    *   `style:` For code formatting
    *   `refactor:` For code cleanup
    *   `test:` For tests
    *   `chore:` For everything else

7.  **Push It:**

    Send your changes up to your forked repo:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/awesome-new-thing
    # or
    git push origin fix/that-pesky-bug
    ```

8.  **Make a Pull Request:**

    Head over to your forked repo on GitHub and click the "Compare & pull request" button. Tell me what you did, why you did it, and any other helpful info.

## Pull Request Tips üßê

*   Make sure your code is easy to read and understand.
*   Write good commit messages (see above!).
*   Include tests (if you can).
*   Be patient! I'll do my best to review your pull request as soon as possible.
*   Be open to feedback and willing to make changes.
